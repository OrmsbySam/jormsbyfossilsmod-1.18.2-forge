Project made by me (code) and my girlfriend, Emilie (art).
Done during Summer 2022, while I was taking a data structures class for C/C++ at UTSA and working as a Team Leader at Whataburger.

Why am I making this?
My girlfriend really wanted a fossil/dinosaur mod in minecraft and couldn't find any that she liked, so she asked me if I could, and I accepted even though I don't have
as much experience with Java as I do with C or C++, I thought it would be a fun project/challenge to do. 

Goals
Add fossil and dinosaurs that you can breed and create zoos for, have stats for them, happiness, hunger, thirst etc...
Add tech for me, like ore crusher, smelter, power sources, and a storage solution.
